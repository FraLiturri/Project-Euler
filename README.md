# Project Euler Solutions ðŸ§®
A collection of my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, solved completely from scratch in Python.

## ðŸ“‹ Description
This repository contains my personal solutions to Project Euler problems. Each solution has been developed independently, implementing all necessary algorithms without using pre-computed data or pre-generated lists (such as prime numbers, factorials, or mathematical constants).

All solutions are optimized to run in reasonable time, following the "few seconds rule". 
The code focuses on algorithmic implementation rather than detailed explanations.
